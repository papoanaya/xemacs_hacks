2006-05-09  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-html): Replace several defvars with
	defconst.

2006-01-02  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-read-time-string): Fixed problem that
	was causing us to send timestamps with two Zs instead of one. This
	may have been the cause of some weird issues.

2006-01-01  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el: Fixed dumb mistake in `delicious-post-cache'.

2005-12-21  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-buffer-finish): Correct use of
	plural based on how many results there are.
	(delicious-search-insert-match): Changed to accept a list as its
	argument.
	(delicious-search-insert-matches): New function to insert a list
	of matches. Updated all of the search functions that can return
	multiple results to use this.

2005-12-17  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-post-cache): Start using assoc-default,
	in many different places. 

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-timestamp): Moved from delicious.el to here.
	(delicious-api-get-timestamp): Use the delicious-timestamp regular
	expression instead of defining another one.

	* delicious.el (delicious-post-cache): Check to make sure the file
	exists, and error if it doesn't.

2005-11-07  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-posts-matching-tags): Added
	(bury-buffer) so that 'q' from the results buffer doesn't take us
	to the .delicious posts buffer.
	(delicious-posts-matching-tags-any): Same here.
	(delicious-posts-matching-date): And here.
	(delicious-post-matching-hash): Here too.
	(delicious-search-href-regexp): And here, also added save-window-excursion.
	(delicious-search-tags-regexp): Same here.
	(delicious-search-description-regexp): And here.
	(delicious-search-posts-regexp): Finally, here.

2005-11-03  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-register-auth): The Debian packaged
	version of url.el is now closer to or even the same as the CVS
	Emacs version. However, the Debian package version still has its
	same old url-version, "Exp"! I applied fixes to make auth work
	again. People using older Debian packaged versions who run into
	trouble will want to either get the CVS Emacs version of the url
	files, or pull the w3-url-e21 package from Debian unstable.

2005-10-23  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-posts-file): New function to return the
	full path for the posts file.
	(delicious-get-posts-buffer): Use new `delicious-posts-file'
	function.
	(delicious-update-timestamp): Use new
	`delicious-posts-file'. Should fix the problem of the disappearing
	timestamp. Thanks to Gunnar Wrobel for the bug report.

2005-10-16  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-update-timestamp): Fix bug that was
	causing the timestamp in new posts files to get bumped to the end
	of the file. 
	(delicious-save-buffer): Add new argument, NO-BURY, for situations
	when we want to save the buffer but not bury it. 

2005-10-13  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (url-auth): Add missing require needed for
	url-version "Emacs", and maybe others too. Solves error about
	url-is-cached.

2005-10-11  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-register-auth): url-version "Emacs"
	requires url-http to be loaded for basic auth to work. 

2005-10-10  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-delete): Look up the post's
	actual url, instead of just copying it from the search results
	buffer. Deleting from the search results buffer should actually
	work now.
	(delicious-update-timestamp): Put the timestamp on its own line in
	the posts file, easier not to accidentally include it in a post
	that way.
	(delicious-search-insert-match): Insert a space if the field is
	empty. This way, the 'e' binding and other text properties will
	work on a blank extended description field.
	(delicious-search-next-result): Improved TAB behavior in the
	search results buffer. Previously it just wrapped to the beginning
	of the buffer when the user was on the last post, but did not
	actually go to the first post in the buffer. Now it does.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-post): Fix bugs with hexifying the
	URL that were causing duplicate posts and stopping the editing
	functions in search mode from working right.

	* delicious.el (delicious-read-extended-description): The server
	accepts a maximum of 253 characters for the extended
	description. Check to see if the input is longer than that,
	suggest a truncation if it is.
	(delicious-skip-timestamp): Account for the possibility of being
	offline. Previously, if the posts file was empty, and you tried to
	delicious-post-offline, we'd get confused and try to contact the
	server.
	(delicious-search-buffer-prep): If we're already in the search
	results buffer, clear it before doing a new search.
	(delicious-search-edit-extended): New command to edit the extended
	description of a post. Just type 'e' when over the extended
	description of a post in the delicious search results buffer.

2005-10-07  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-register-auth): Modified to account
	for the way auth storage is handled in url-version "Emacs", which
	is what is included in CVS Emacs. Also add check earlier in the
	file to catch an url-version that we won't support at all right
	now. "Emacs" and "Exp" should both be acceptable url versions now.

	* delicious.el (delicious-skip-timestamp): New function used in
	reading info from the posts buffer. Adjusted all the necessary
	functions to use it.
	
2005-10-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* README (Keywords): Modified setup instructions. You now need to
	add (delicious-api-register-auth) somewhere in your .emacs after
	setting your username and password in order to avoid being
	prompted for that information. 

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-from): Removed, since we are now
	relying on `url-privacy-level' for which information should be
	included in the header of each request. 
	(delicious-api-build-html-request): Remove HTTP header setup,
	since we are using url.el for that.
	(url-auth): Has to be loaded for us to register delicious auth
	information. 
	(delicious-auth): Moved to Setup section.

	* README: Removed description of timeout. Remove
	delicious-api-from, since we will rely on the general
	`url-privacy-level' settings for this.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-timeout): Removed, since we are now
	relying on url.el for this.

2005-10-02  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-realm): New variable to hold the
	auth realm name.
	(delicious-api-port): New variable to hold the port number.
	(delicious-api-register-auth): New function to register auth
	information for the url library.
	(url-http-user-agent-string): Advise to use our specific
	user-agent string when called during a delicious-api request.
	(delicious-api-send-request): Set the flag to get the right
	user-agent. 

2005-09-23  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-send-request): Deleted. 
	(delicious-api-build-request): We don't need to add the HTTP
	headers anymore.
	(delicious-api-send-request): New, simplified version that makes
	use of the url library, which we are already requiring.
	(delicious-api-version): Incremented to 0.3 in honor of major
	change in how we communicate with the server.

2005-09-07  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-delete): New command in the
	search result buffer. Hit 'd' on the url to delete the post. I'm
	aware of a bug with the add and delete tag functions that cause
	posts to be duplicated. Will fix later today.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-delete): Fixed major bug in url
	encoding that was causing delete to fail.

2005-09-05  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-insert-match): Add binding for c
	to delicious search mode, to append the url with no properties to
	the kill ring.
	(delicious-search-copy-url): New command for the above binding.

2005-09-03  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-get-all): Add optional tag
	argument, which has been available in the server API for a while
	now. Fix indentation.

2005-08-30  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-get-posts-buffer): Return the buffer.
	(delicious-search-add-tags): Don't assume that everyone is using
	~/.delicious for their posts file.
	(delicious-search-delete-tags): Don't assume that everyone is
	using ~/.delicious for their posts file.
	(delicious-search-delete-tags): Forgot to turn off read-only when
	updating the record after making changes.
	(delicious-search-add-tags): Forgot to turn off read-only here
	too.
	(delicious-search-mode-map): Add binding for q to bury the buffer.

2005-08-24  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-buffer-prep): I guess we'll make
	this buffer read-only after all, after my comical experience of
	typing something by accident and then trying to delete it with
	backspace, which caused the screen to scroll, etc.
	(delicious-search-insert-match): Inhibit read-only while inserting
	matches.
	(delicious-search-buffer-finish): Need to inhibit read-only here
	too.

2005-08-18  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-posts-narrow-by-date): Change name of
	date narrowing function to make namespace room for an interactive
	command to search all posts by date.
	(delicious-posts-matching-date): New function to return all posts
	matching a date.

	* planner-delicious.el (planner-delicious-posts-match-any): Change
	name of date narrowing function.
	(planner-delicious-posts-match-all): Change name of date narrowing
	function.
	(planner-delicious-append-posts-match-date): New command to append
	posts matching a date regexp.
	(planner-delicious-rewrite-posts-match-date): New command to
	replace current delicious section with posts matching a date
	regexp.
	(planner-delicious-rewrite): Remove blank lines between
	links. Keep one blank line at the top of the section and one at
	the bottom.
	(planner-delicious-append): Remove blank lines between links. Keep
	one blank line at the beginning of the appended chunk and one at
	the end.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-send-request): Fixed bug reported by
	Gunnar Wrobel that prevented things from working with Squid (and
	probably other proxies too).

2005-08-09  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-delete-tags): Replaced ugly
	substring hack with something better.

2005-08-08  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-post-matching-hash): Forgot to make the
	OFFLINE argument optional.
	(delicious-search-who-else): Changed to use the url?url form,
	because Joshua says we can't rely on the md5 hash.
	(delicious-read-time-string): Use the current time if no time
	string is entered. Didn't I do this before?
	(delicious-complete-tags): Forgot to respect the offline argument
	when building the tags list.
	(delicious-build-tags-list): Forgot here too.
	(delicious-save-buffer): Bury the buffer here, so we don't have to
	do it twenty other places.
	(delicious-post-cache): Use ASSOC instead of ELT; safer when then
	list structure changes a bit.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-post): Oops, I was escaping all the
	fields but the URL. Escape the URL, so addresses with ampersands
	and things in them will work.

	* delicious.el (delicious-edit-post-locally): New internal
	function to update specific fields in a local copy of a post.
	(delicious-post): New NOLOCAL argument to stop local addition of
	posts. Needed to prevent duplication when we are editing posts in
	Delicious Search mode.
	(delicious-complete-tags): Ugly hack to remove trailing space on
	tags, until I get time to rewrite this loop.
	(delicious-search-delete-tags): New function to delete tags from a
	post. Bound to `d' in Delicious Search mode when you are over the
	tags line.
	(delicious-search-who-else): New interactive command in Delicious
	Search mode to browse to a page showing who else has bookmarked
	this URL. Bound to `w' in Delicious Search mode when you are over
	any field in a record.
	(delicious-post): Compute the hash so we have a copy of it to
	store locally.
	(delicious-post-local): Oops, fix the argument passed to
	delicious-rebuild-tags-maybe.
	(delicious-post-offline): Compute the hash.

2005-08-07  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-guess-url-methods): Customize this to
	set which methods and what order you would like URL guessing to

	else matches.

	to a post while on the tags field in the *delicious search
	results* buffer. It is bound to 'a'.

	* delicious.el (delicious-build-tags-list): Added condition-case
	for EOF in `delicious-posts-buffer'.

	`delicious-posts-buffer'.
	(delicious-search-posts-regexp): Added condition-case.

	(delicious-posts-matching-tags-any): Added condition-case.

	nice.
	(delicious-build-posts-list): Switch to pretty printing.

2005-08-04  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-insert-match): Add a hash
	property to each bit of text in the search results buffer, so that
	we can easily know which post it came from. We can do fun things
	with this later.
	(delicious-search-hash): New function to find a post by its hash.

	* README: Removed description of delicious-build-tags-list, since
	we don't have that command anymore. Add note about how to force a
	post refresh from the server. Improved the searching section in
	light of recent changes and gave more explanation for what to do
	in the event of an HTTP error.

	* delicious.el (delicious-update-timestamp): Bury the
	delicious-posts-buffer when we're done.

	we're done.
	(delicious-post-local): Bury the delicious-posts-buffer when we're
	done.
	(delicious-search-insert-match): Make links clickable. Stop
	displaying the hash, no one cares about it. Buttonize tags, with
	the action of listing all the posts with that tag.
	(delicious-search-mode-map): Remove binding for return, since
	we're handling that as text property now.
	(delicious-search-mode-map): Fixed bindings for delete and space.
	(delicious-save-buffer): New function to save the
	delicious-posts-buffer, so we can set some local variables while
	doing it. Changed every appearance of save-buffer to this new
	function.
	
2005-08-03  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-build-posts-list): Added FORCE argument
	to force a refresh from the server. Provide better information
	about which source the posts are being updated from. Check to make
	sure that both FORCE and OFFLINE aren't non-nil at the same
	time. Prefix argument causes the same behavior as FORCE when used
	interactively.
	(delicious-build-posts-list): Small changes to update messages,
	fix message displayed when a prefix is used.

2005-08-01  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	`delicious-posts-matching-any'.

	`delicious-posts-matching-tags'.
	(delicious-get-posts-from-stored): Removed. Getting posts from the
	stored file happens automatically when appropriate now.
	(delicious-posts-matching-date): New name for
	`delicious-test-date-regexp'. Also now accepts a list of posts to
	check instead of just one.

2005-07-31  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-delicious.el (planner-delicious-append-posts): New function.

	* delicious.el (delicious-posts-matching-tags-any): New function.

2005-07-28  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-tags): Moved actual searching
	into new function `delicious-posts-matching-tags'.

	* README: Removed descriptions for `delicious-load-posts' and
	`delicious-save-posts'. Updated description of HTTP error
	handling.

	* delicious.el (delicious-save-posts): Removed command, because we
	now always have a local copy of the posts.

2005-07-26  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-tags): Modified to work offline,
	use the .delicious buffer, and not use CL.

2005-07-25  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-description-regexp): Modified to
	search buffer instead of variable. Now reports an error if it
	finds a post with no description in it, as this shouldn't happen.

2005-07-18  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-guess-url): Don't check the clipboard if
	we're not in X.
	(delicious-post): Moved local adding of posts to
	`delicious-post-local'. Moved addition of tags to the completion
	table to `delicious-rebuild-tags-maybe'.
	(delicious-read-url): Changed to accommodate split of

	argument so if we are offline, we call
	`delicious-build-posts-list' accordingly.

	function `delicious-post-duplicate-p'. If it is a duplicate,
	return the post.

	for a duplicate post. In the future this will display some
	information about the current copy of the post.
	(delicious-build-posts-list): Changed to build the posts list in a
	buffer. Also, we now check timestamps on the server and locally to
	see whether we need to rebuild the list, if we are online.
	(delicious-load-posts-file): Removed, we don't need it
	anymore. The local post list is loaded as soon as we try to post.
	(delicious-build-tags-list): Changed to build the tag completion
	table from the local posts, instead of through an api call to the
	server. Added OFFLINE argument.

	server's posts are newer than ours.
	(delicious-get-local-timestamp): New function to read the
	timestamp from the local file.

	local timestamp into a time value.
	(delicious-format-time): Turn time value into a delicious
	timestamp.

2005-07-12  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-update-timestamp): New function to add a

	(delicious-get-local-timestamp): New function to read the saved
	timestamp.

2005-06-30  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-read-time-string): Now explicitly return
	the current date and time as the timestamp if nothing is entered
	at the date prompt, instead of depending on the server.

2005-06-22  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-success-match): Fixed bug in
	regular expression to match successful output. The error was
	preventing `delicious-api-get-timestamp' from working properly.

2005-06-21  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-mode-map): Shift-TAB now goes to
	previous result. M-n now goes to next result, M-p to previous
	result, while in the search results buffer. RET will browse the
	link at point.
	(delicious-search-buffer-prep): Entering delicious-search-mode no
	longer involves entering View mode.
	(delicious-search-buffer-finish): Removed view mode from here too.

2005-06-20  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-post-offline): New command, post while

	filename.

2005-06-12  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-w3m-html): Fixed so that it actually
	uses 15 for the default number if you hit return.

2005-06-05  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-send-request): Fixed error checking so
	that it doesn't lie and say everything is fine when there is a 503
	error. Some line length cleanups. Added specific error message for
	when you have been banned by the server.

2005-05-18  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-delicious.el (planner-delicious-insert-posts): Copied
	some sanity checks from planner-diary.el to make sure we're not
	mangling an innocent buffer.
	(planner-delicious-insert-posts-all): New interactive command to
	insert posts matching all of a list of tags, and optionally a
	date.
	(planner-delicious-insert-posts-any): New interactive command to
	insert posts matching any of a list of tags, and optionally a
	date.
	(planner-delicious-insert-posts): Added safety check to throw an
	error when you try to match a tag you have never used before,
	until I understand the bug. Without this, emacs was locking up in
	this case.

2005-05-12  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-get-timestamp): Use existing
	XML-parsing functions instead of a special one for
	timestamp. Function now returns a time value.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-parse-timestamp): Deleted, since
	we're using the existing XML-parsing functions.
	
2005-05-10  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-parse-timestamp): New function.
	(delicious-api-get-timestamp): New function to make the API call
	to get the timestamp of the last update from the server.

	* delicious.el (delicious-build-posts-list): Added "Done" message.

2005-05-08  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-guess-url): Fixed bug caused by recent
	changes in url guessing that required something to be in the
	clipboard before posting. 

2005-05-06  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-get-posts-from-stored): Added new
	argument TAG-MATCH-TYPE. Instead of filtering posts by a regexp
	for tags, the user can now specify whether they want posts with
	all of the tags, or with any of the tags. Broke filtering logic
	into separate functions.
	(delicious-test-tag-all): New function to test whether a post has
	all of the given tags.
	(delicious-test-tag-any): New function to test whether a post has
	any of the given tags.

	* planner-delicious.el (planner-delicious-insert-posts): Updated
	to use new format of `delicious-get-posts-from-stored'.

	* delicious.el (delicious-test-date-regexp): New function to find 
	posts with dates matching a regexp.

2005-05-06  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-complete-tags): Fixed mistake in number
	of arguments for prompt format string.

2005-05-04  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el: Updated FSF address in copyright header.
	(delicious-api-post): Fixed long lines.
	(delicious-api-get-tags): Fixed long lines.

	* delicious.el: Updated FSF address in copyright header.

	* README: Explained new rename command. Updated the address of the
	FSF in the copyright header.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-rename): Added correct URL string-escaping.

	* delicious.el (delicious-complete-tags): Added QUANTITY argument,
	so that we can use this to only read a specific number of
	tags. Also added arguments to customize the prompt, and a REQUIRE
	argument to require a completion match. These are all helpful for
	reading tags for `delicious-rename-tag'.
	(delicious-rename-tag): New interactive command to rename all
	instances of one tag to one or more tags.

2005-05-01  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* README: Updated documentation.

	* delicious.el (delicious-guess-url): Added the clipboard
	selection to the url-guessing formula. So if the user highlights
	and copies a URL from another X program, it should show up as the
	default value when posting. 

2005-04-27  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-get-posts-from-stored): Changed TAG to
	be a regexp. This way the user has more flexibility in searching
	their tags.
	(delicious-get-posts-from-stored): TAG and DATE are no longer
	optional. If the user doesn't want to filter by TAG or DATE, they
	can just use the appropriate regexp.

	* planner-delicious.el (planner-delicious-insert-posts): Renamed
	function from (planner-rewrite-delicious-posts). Used
	(planner-make-link) to simplify code.
	(planner-delicious-section): New variable so the user can define
	the title of the section where del.icio.us bookmarks should be
	inserted. Copied section rewriting code from
	`planner-accomplishments.el'.
	(planner-delicious-insert-posts): Added DATE argument again, since
	it works now.

	* delicious.el (delicious-get-posts-from-stored): Filtering by
	date now works.

2005-04-26  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-delicious.el (planner-rewrite-delicious-posts): Fixed
	bug that was causing infinite loop when highlighting. TAG is now a
	mandatory argument (temporarily), and I've removed DATE until I
	implement the date filtering. 

2005-04-25  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-get-posts-from-stored): Bugfix, added
	check to make sure that DELICIOUS-POSTS-LIST exists before
	searching it.

2005-04-21  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-add-tags): Fixed to keep the tag
	completion list updated after each post is made without having to
	talk to the server. 
	(delicious-complete-tags): Removed `delicious-tags-local', since
	we no longer maintain a separate local tags list.
	(delicious-build-tags-list): Removed `delicious-tags-local', since
	we no longer maintain a separate local tags list.

2005-04-21  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-delicious.el: Added missing (provide).

2005-04-21  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el: Docstring fixes to pass checkdoc.

	* planner-delicious.el: Added copyright header information.

2005-04-21 johnsu01 <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el: Numerous docstring fixes to pass checkdoc.

2005-03-31  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-load-posts-file): Fixed a problem that
	was preventing save-excursion from working. 
	(delicious-get-posts-from-stored): Filters stored posts by
	tag. Date is not yet working. 

	* readme: Documented `delicious-load-posts' and
	`delicious-save-posts'.
	
	* delicious.el (delicious-load-posts): Interactive command
	which Reads the contents of the posts file into
	`delicious-posts-list'.

2005-03-30  johnsu01  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-save-posts): New interactive command to
	save your posts to a file.

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-posts-file-name): New option for
	defining the file name in which your delicious posts will be saved.

2005-02-13  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-read-time-string): Corrected time-string
	prompt format.
	(delicious-suggest-tags): Added rudimentary handling of plurals,
	so that matches are suggested even if they are off by an 's' or
	'es'. More interesting stemming stuff to come, I hope. 
	(delicious-post): Bugfix so that tags are really getting added to
	the local tags list immediately after posting.

2005-02-11  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-read-time-string): Added check to make
	sure that the format of the time time string is correct. Now you
	can just enter the numbers separated by whatever you want, and
	we'll fill in the -'s and :'- and T and Z for you. 

2005-02-10  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* README: Updated README to reflect the fact that there is no
	longer a separate local posts list.

	* delicious.el (delicious-complete-tags): Added duplicate checking
	to prompt. If you enter a tag you've already entered, you'll get a
	quick message about the duplicate tag being ignored. Yes, I do
	this a lot. This isn't actually necessary, because internally the
	duplicate tag was ignored anyway, and the server probably ignores
	it too, but anyway. I feel cleaner now. 
	(delicious-post): Eliminated separate list of posted urls. Posts
	are now added to delicious-posts-list, which means that posts you
	have made in your current session are now searched when you do
	search commands. In theory, the only time you should have to
	refresh information from the server now is after you have posted
	from an external interface or something has gone wrong.

2005-02-09  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* README: Updated explanation of delicious-build-tags-list to
	account for improved tag completion handling. Also modified
	explanation of delicious-build-posts-list for similar reasons.
	Updated the copyright notice.

	* delicious.el (delicious-complete-tags): Cosmetic fix to docstring.
	(delicious-complete-tags): Deleted to-do comment.
	(delicious-post): Added call to delicious-add-tags to modify the
	local copy of the tags list for completion purposes.
	(delicious-add-tags): New function that updates the local copy of the
	tags table with the tags you just posted, so that refreshing it
	periodically from the server is less necessary. They will now be
	available for completion immediately.

2005-02-08  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicioapi.el (delicious-send-request): Added immediate check to
	make sure we received an HTTP 200 header, and error out if we do
	not. This replaces the previous faulty error checking.
	(delicious-api-error-match): Removed this variable.

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-mode-map): Moved keymap out of
	delicious-search-mode macro and into its own variable.
	(delicious-search-mode): Moved keymap to
	delicious-search-mode-map.

	* README: Added note about dependency on external url.el, not
	distributed with delicious-el.

2005-02-07  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-buffer-finish): Changed order to
	activate View mode before Delicious Search mode.
	(delicious-search-previous-result): New function to move backwards
	by link in the search results buffer.
	
	* README: Added documentation section "* Interactive search
	commands" with information about all of the new searching functions.

	* delicious.el (delicious-search-posts-regexp): Added match
	counting for display in the search results buffer.
	(delicious-search-description-regexp): Added match counting for
	display in the search results buffer.
	(delicious-search-tags-regexp): Added match counting for display
	in search results buffer.
	(delicious-search-link-regexp): Added match counting for display
	in search results buffer.
	(delicious-search-href-regexp): Changed name of
	delicious-search-link-regexp to delicious-search-href-regexp.
	(delicious-search-tags): Added match counting for display in
	search results buffer.

Sun Feb  6 16:17:22 EST 2005  John Sullivan <john@wjsullivan.net>
  * Improvements to *delicious search results* buffer and window handling
  
  * New delicious-search-buffer-prep function to consolidate preparation common
    between the search functions. This affects all delicious-search-* functions.
  
  * New delicious-search-buffer-finish function to consolidate post-searching
    duties between the search functions. This affects all delicious-search-*
    functions.
  
  * If a search function is called from the *delicious search results* buffer, we
    don't switch windows. 
  
  * *delicious search results* buffer is now in read-only View Mode, for easier
     scrolling.
