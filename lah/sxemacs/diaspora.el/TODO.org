#+SEQ_TODO:  TODO PARTIALLY-DONE | DONE 

* Interface Features [1/3]
** DONE Main menu
   There is a Main menu now! :)

** PARTIALLY-DONE Organize Customization Group for Diaspora
** TODO Add icons image to the likes, reshare, and comments

* Notification Features [0/2]
** TODO Makes notifications "very" visible by the user
   Notifications are importants in some way, make them visible as soon as the user calls the =diaspora= function.

   Maybe finding the way to get the amount of unreaded notifications and make it visible in the status line.

** TODO Let the user change a notification state
   Unreaded notifications doesn't change its states, never will change to "readed"!

   There must be a button that change it state.

* Stream, Comments and Posting Features [5/7]
** DONE Put the comments in the stream buffer
   It should be possible to read comments in the stream buffer, as seen on the diaspora web.
** DONE Show how much people and who likes a message
   Like feature is working, diaspora.el only shows how many people likes something... but who are those people?

** TODO Show how much people and who shares a message
   The share feature is working, but diaspora.el doesn't have it yet :-( 

** DONE Get the streams from an interval of dates
   The stream we actually fetch are from the current date. But what about the other posts?   

** TODO Add the "amount of reshares" element apart from amount of like and amount of comments

** DONE What about a user stream? 
   There is no function for retrieving all user posts apart from 
   :diaspora-get-stream-by-name "u/username"
** DONE And the stream for an aspect?
   Get a stream only for a selected aspect.

* Privates Message Features [2/3]

  - [X] See the list of messages
