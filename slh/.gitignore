# This file is used to ignore certain files in the repo, such as
# anything that is generated by the build, etc.

# This project uses a single .gitignore, so please DO NOT add
# any .gitignore files to any of the sub directories.
#
# NOTE! Please use 'git ls-files -i --exclude-standard' command after
# changing this file, to see if there are any tracked files which get
# ignored after the change.
