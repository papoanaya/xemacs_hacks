Here is a small collection of (mostly) my hacks.  Some of which are
even useful.

dired-tar.el       -- Handle tarballs in Dired.  Updated to support
                      bzip2, lzma, and xz.
ffi-mpd.el         -- non-working
ges-post.el        -- Ease sending lisp to gnu.emacs.sources
google-query.el    -- Search Google from within (S)XEmacs
linux-kernel.el    -- Check the lastest Linux kernel release
lj.el              -- Post entries to a LiveJournal blog
mozmail.el         -- Compose mail in a emacs MUA from mailto links in
                      Mozilla
patch-keywords.el  -- An aid for XEmacs patch reviewers
pkg-build.el       -- Automate the drudgery of the XEmacs Packages
                      Release Manager
pui-update.el      -- Update XEmacs packages from cron (non-working)
sxell.el           -- SXEmacs interface to the Emacs Lisp List
snap.el            -- An updated version of snap.el (from the howm
		      guy).  This one supports (S)XEmacs.


Installation:
============
Basically, put it in you load-path, optionally byte-compile it, add
(require '<libname>) in your `user-init-file'.

See the comments in each file for any idiosyncrasies or unusual set up
procedures.
